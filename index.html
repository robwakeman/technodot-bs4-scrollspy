          <h4 class="mt-4">Detroit Techno</h4>
          <p>Detroit techno is a type of techno music that generally includes the first techno productions by Detroit-based artists during the 1980s and early 1990s. Prominent Detroit techno artists include Juan Atkins, Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May, Jeff Mills, Kevin Saunderson, Blake Baxter, Drexciya and Mike Banks.</p>
          <p>The three individuals most closely associated with the birth of Detroit techno as a genre are Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson and Derrick May, also known as the "Belleville Three".[1] The three, who were high school friends from Belleville, Michigan, created electronic music tracks in their basement(s). Derrick May once described Detroit techno music as being a "complete mistake ... like George Clinton and Kraftwerk caught in an elevator, with only a sequencer to keep them company.</p>
          <p>While attending Washtenaw Community College, Atkins met Rick Davis and formed Cybotron with him. Their first single "Alleys of Your Mind", recorded on their Deep Space label in 1981, sold 15,000 copies, and the success of two follow-up singles, "Cosmic Cars" and "Clear," led the California-based label Fantasy to sign the duo and release their album, Clear. After Cybotron split due to creative differences, Atkins began recording as Model 500 on his own label, Metroplex, in 1985. His landmark single, "No UFOs," soon arrived. Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Robert Hood also recorded on Metroplex. May said that the suburban setting afforded a different setting in which to experience the music. "We perceived the music differently than you would if you encountered it in dance clubs. We'd sit back with the lights off and listen to records by Bootsy and Yellow Magic Orchestra. We never took it as just entertainment, we took it as a serious philosophy," recalls May.</p>
          <p>The three teenage friends bonded while listening to an eclectic mix of music: Yellow Magic Orchestra, Kraftwerk, Bootsy, Parliament, Prince, Depeche Mode, and The B-52's. Juan Atkins was inspired to buy a synthesizer after hearing Parliament. Atkins was also the first in the group to take up turntablism, teaching May and Saunderson how to DJ.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Minimal Techno</h4>
          <p>Minimal techno is a minimalist subgenre of techno music.[1] It is characterized by a stripped-down[2] aesthetics that exploits the use of repetition and understated development. Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell.[3][4] By the early 2000s the term 'minimal' generally described a style of techno that was popularised in Germany by labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, and Richie Hawtin's M-nus, among others.</p>
          <p>Minimal techno first emerged in the early 1990s. The development of the style is often attributed to a so-called "second wave" of American producers associated with Detroit techno. According to Derrick May, "while the first-wave artists were enjoying their early global success, techno also inspired many up-and-coming DJs and bedroom producers in Detroit".[5] This younger generation included producers such as Richie Hawtin, Daniel Bell, Robert Hood, Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Kenny Larkin, and Mike Banks. The work of several of these artists evolved to become focused on minimalism.</p>
          <p>Robert Hood describes the situation in the early 1990s as one where techno had become too "ravey", with increasing tempos leading to the emergence of gabber. Such trends saw the demise of the soul-infused techno that typified the original Detroit sound. Robert Hood has noted that he and Daniel Bell both realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave era, and saw that an important feature of the original techno sound had been lost. Hood states that "it sounded great from a production standpoint, but there was a 'jack' element in the [old] structure. People would complain that there's no funk, no feeling in techno anymore, and the easy escape is to put a vocalist and some piano on top to fill the emotional gap. I thought it was time for a return to the original underground.</p>
          <p>The minimal techno sound that emerged at this time has been defined by Robert Hood as "a basic stripped down, raw sound. Just drums, basslines and funky grooves and only what's essential. Only what is essential to make people move. I started to look at it as a science, the art of making people move their butts, speaking to their heart, mind and soul. It's a heart-felt rhythmic techno sound."[6] Daniel Bell has commented that he had a dislike for minimalism in the artistic sense of the word, finding it too "arty".</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Jeff Mills</h4>
          <p>Jeff Mills, along with Robert Hood, Carl Craig, and Joey Beltram, is one of the biggest American names in techno. Championed for his music's relentless pursuit of hardness and his stripped-down, almost industrial DJ sets, Mills is the latest in a long..</p>
          <p>A founding member of noted Motor City institution Underground Resistance, Mills helped build the artist roster and label ideology (as well as much of its back catalog) with partners "Mad" Mike Banks and Robert "Noise" Hood before moving to New York in 1992 to pursue more vigorously his solo and DJ career (with a resident spot at the legendary Limelight and a recording contract with the noted German label Tresor). (Although rumors of bad blood between the early UR crew have been denied by all involved, Mills' decision to split was apparently total, with Banks all but repudiating his involvement with Mills and Mills distancing himself from the continuing political militancy of Banks and the UR organization.)</p>
          <p>Mills' UR-related releases (including "The Punisher" and "Seawolf") are stripped-down and erratic, fusing elements of hardcore acid and industrial techno to the sparse Detroit aesthetic. Not surprisingly, his post-UR sound hasn't eased a bit, although UR's penchant for the four-track has been replaced by higher-quality production.</p>
          <p>Prior to his involvement in UR, Mills was a DJ at Detroit public radio station WDET (he was also studying architecture at the time), spinning everything from Meat Beat Manifesto and Nine Inch Nails to Chicago house and underground Detroit techno. He began producing in the mid-'80s, working with Tony Srock on the project the Final Cut.</p>
          <p>Mills met Banks through a local garage group Members of the House, who Banks was working with in the late '80s. Mills remixed a track on a Members 12-inch, and his and Banks' shared love for Chicago soul and the harder edge of Detroit techno blossomed into Underground Resistance as a combined business and creative enterprise. The pair, along with Robert Hood, recorded several EPs and singles together, including tracks such as "Waveform," and "Sonic," before Mills defected to New York in 1992 to pursue a residency at the Limelight club and a solo career recording for Tresor and his own label, Axis. Mills' discography includes two full-length volumes of Waveform Transmissions for Tresor, a live album and rarities collection for the British label React, and the first album in a new contract with Sony Japan, as well as a handful of 12-inch EPs on Axis and several collaborations with Robert Hood on his M-Plant label. In 2000, Mills took more memorable action by scoring a new soundtrack for Fritz Lang's 1926 film Metropolis, screened around the world at venues including the Museum of Music in Paris, London's Royal Albert Hall, and the Vienna International Film Festival.</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">DJ Rush</h4>
          <p>DJ Rush's hard techno sets are legendary from his birthplace of Chicago to his adopted home of Berlin. A 6’6” self-styled freak, the producer of such monsters as ‘Freaks on Hubbard’ and ‘Get On Up’ frequently mixes techno with fishnets and stilettos...</p>
          <p>DJ RUSH draws on his varied taste in music from contemporary Brazilian Jazz, and rare disco to The Beatles to take you on a tour of the deep side of reality, mind and soul through his vision of rhythmic percussive style. Rush gives recordings physical and mindpuzzling energy. The 6'6" giants' open minded attitude to life is: Take me for what I am or don't take me at all. Born in Chicago (USA), he grew up on the South Side and started to party at a very young age, immediately picking up on the fever of the music. He would attend clubs like The Ringzone, Playground, The Candystore and The Music Box. Before he began playing gigs in Chicago, he started making tracks in his bedroom with his friends' sinsonic drums. In Rushs' own words, "It's always important and interesting to make music according to your feelings and experiences" which is exactly what he does with The Energy EP. He likes to play with voices and percussion (his percussion is both wicked and legendary) in his many releases.</p>
          <p>Throughout the years DJ RUSH has committed himself to the art of rhythm & drums. Born in the big city of Chicago, his music is heard throughout the world, including such famous tunes as Spitball, I Love You, and Mutha Fucking Bass. Although much of Rush's work is used for many mix compilations, some of his most famous moments have come from his live performances. In 1989 Rush had his first residency in a club called the Reactor in Chicago playing 70's disco for a crowd of 800, including 10 hour non-stop sets for party kids. He then continued to play for the famous Medusa club, Power House, Music Box, and Warehouse. Quickly becoming a central figure in Chicago's house scene, Rush's uniqueness and individuality has always been portrayed in his productions and djing. "Not letting the music control me, but letting the music guide me"</p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Dave Clarke</h4>
          <p>He may be known as The Baron Of Techno, a moniker given to him by renowned BBC Radio DJ / journalist John Peel, but Dave Clarke has an anarchist streak a mile wide and punk in his soul, having no truck with establishment figures or authoritarianism.</p>
          <p>Dave Clarke is a DJ with an anarchist streak a mile wide and punk in his soul. Nothing says this as potently as his new album, ‘The Desecration of Desire’. Electronic to the hilt yet full of rich, dark songwriting, it’s been almost two years in the making and comes 14 years after his last full-length outing.</p>
          <p>“The desire to write songs has been bubbling in me for ages,” Clarke explains, “My first album was a collection of tracks, the ‘Red’ series of EPs, plus other stuff. With my second, even access to my studio was an issue. Those two felt like collections. This one’s more like a book, a chronology. I’m so happy with my studio. I’ve stayed away from club music. Finally, it’s just me, my imagination and a touch of fearlessness about opening up.”</p>
          <p>Dave Clarke has long embraced sounds outside staunch electronic dance, from Savages to Idles to old favourites Bauhaus. Such music informs his attitude as a DJ, using Serato on a 13” Macbook Pro Retina for ruthlessly effective, fat-free techno and electro sets. It also heavily flavours his new album, on which he’s worked with vocalists such as US alt-rocker Mark Lanegan, gothic synth don Mt. Sims, Brighton electronic artist Gazelle Twin, and Portishead associate Anika. He’s even included a version of new wave cult hit ‘Is Vic There?’ (originally by Department S) featuring Paris-based DJ-producer Louisahhh.</p>
